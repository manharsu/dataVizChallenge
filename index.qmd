## The Problem: Mastering Object-Oriented Matplotlib Through the Four Stages

**Core Question:** How can we create compelling, professional data visualizations using object-oriented matplotlib and the four stages of visualization?

**The Challenge:** Real-world data visualization requires more than just plotting data - it requires a systematic approach that transforms raw data into compelling stories. The four stages framework provides a proven methodology for creating visualizations that inform, persuade, and inspire action.

**Our Approach:** We'll work with baseball stadium data to investigate whether Coors Field in Denver, Colorado is truly the most run-friendly ballpark in Major League Baseball. This investigation will take us through all four stages of visualization, demonstrating object-oriented matplotlib techniques along the way.

## ⚠️ AI Partnership Required

This challenge pushes boundaries intentionally. You'll tackle problems that normally require weeks of study, but with Cursor AI as your partner (and your brain keeping it honest), you can accomplish more than you thought possible.

**The new reality:** The four stages of competence are Ignorance → Awareness → Learning → Mastery. AI lets us produce Mastery-level work while operating primarily in the Awareness stage. I focus on awareness training, you leverage AI for execution, and together we create outputs that used to require years of dedicated study.

## The Four Stages of Data Visualization

The four essential stages for creating effective visualizations are:

1. **Stage 1: Declaration of Purpose** - Define your message and audience
2. **Stage 2: Curation of Content** - Gather and create all necessary data
3. **Stage 3: Structuring of Visual Mappings** - Choose geometry and aesthetics
4. **Stage 4: Formatting for Your Audience** - Polish for professional presentation

## Data and Business Context

We analyze Major League Baseball stadium data to investigate whether Coors Field in Denver, Colorado is truly the most run-friendly ballpark. This dataset is ideal for our analysis because:

- **Real Business Question:** Sports analysts and fans want to understand stadium effects on scoring
- **Clear Hypothesis:** High altitude should make Coors Field more run-friendly
- **Multiple Metrics:** We can analyze both total runs and home runs
- **Visualization Practice:** Perfect for demonstrating all four stages of visualization

## Data Loading and Initial Exploration

Let's start by loading the baseball data and understanding what we're working with.

```{python}
#| label: load-data
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns

# Load 2010 baseball season data
df2010 = pd.read_csv("baseball10.csv")

# Load 2021 baseball season data for comparison
df2021 = pd.read_csv("baseball21.csv")

print("2010 data shape:", df2010.shape)
print("2021 data shape:", df2021.shape)
print("\n2010 data columns:", df2010.columns.tolist())
print("\nFirst few rows of 2010 data:")
print(df2010.head())
```

::: {.callout-note}
## 💡 Understanding the Data

**Baseball Game Data:** Contains information about each game, including:
- `home`: Home team (3-letter code)
- `visiting`: Visiting team (3-letter code)
- `homeScore`: Runs scored by home team
- `visScore`: Runs scored by visiting team
- `homeHR`: Home runs by home team
- `visHR`: Home runs by visiting team
- `date`: Game date

**Business Questions We'll Answer:**
1. Is Coors Field (COL) the most run-friendly ballpark in 2010?
2. How does this change in 2021?
3. What's the difference between total runs and home runs by stadium?
:::

## Stage 1: Declaration of Purpose

**Mental Model:** Start with a clear message and bold title that states your recommendation.

Our purpose is to investigate whether Coors Field in Denver, Colorado is truly the most run-friendly baseball stadium in Major League Baseball.

::: {.callout-important}
## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Stage 1 - Declaration of Purpose

**Question 1: Hypothesis Formation**
- Why might high altitude affect baseball performance?  Is Coors Field affected by high altitude?

**Answer:**

High altitude significantly affects baseball performance due to the reduced air density at higher elevations. Coors Field, located in Denver, Colorado at 5,280 feet above sea level, is the highest ballpark in Major League Baseball and experiences pronounced effects from this altitude.

**Primary Mechanisms of High Altitude Effects:**

1. **Reduced Air Density Impact on Batted Balls:**
   - At 5,280 feet, the thinner air offers less resistance to batted balls
   - Baseballs can travel approximately 9% farther than at sea level
   - A 400-foot home run at sea level could extend to about 440 feet at Coors Field
   - This creates more home runs and extra-base hits

2. **Diminished Pitch Movement:**
   - Breaking pitches (curveballs, sliders) experience less movement due to reduced air resistance
   - Fastballs exhibit less "rise" due to decreased Magnus effect in thinner air
   - Pitchers lose some of their ability to fool hitters with movement

3. **Humidor Mitigation:**
   - Coors Field implemented a humidor in 2002 to store baseballs at controlled humidity
   - This reduces ball liveliness and helps balance the game dynamics
   - The humidor partially counteracts the altitude effects

**Hypothesis Formation:**

Given these physical effects, we can form several testable hypotheses about Coors Field:

1. **Primary Hypothesis:** Coors Field will have higher average runs per game compared to sea-level stadiums due to increased offensive production
2. **Secondary Hypothesis:** Coors Field will have higher home run rates per game compared to other stadiums
3. **Tertiary Hypothesis:** The gap between Coors Field and other stadiums may have decreased after the humidor implementation in 2002

Our data analysis will test whether Coors Field (COL) truly lives up to its reputation as the most run-friendly ballpark in Major League Baseball.

## Stage 2: Curation of Content

**Mental Model:** Gather and create all the data you need to support your message.

Let's aggregate the data to get average runs per stadium:

```{python}
#| label: stage-2-content
#| echo: true

# Stage 2: Curation of Content
# Aggregate data to get average runs per stadium

# Process 2010 data
avgDF_2010 = (df2010
    .assign(totalRuns = lambda df: df.homeScore + df.visScore)
    .assign(totalHR = lambda df: df.homeHR + df.visHR)
    .drop(columns = ['date', 'visiting'])
    .groupby(['home'], as_index=False)
    .mean()
)

# Process 2021 data
avgDF_2021 = (df2021
    .assign(totalRuns = lambda df: df.homeScore + df.visScore)
    .assign(totalHR = lambda df: df.homeHR + df.visHR)
    .drop(columns = ['date', 'visiting'])
    .groupby(['home'], as_index=False)
    .mean()
)

print("2010 Stadium Averages (Top 5):")
print(avgDF_2010.head())
print("\n2021 Stadium Averages (Top 5):")
print(avgDF_2021.head())
```

::: {.callout-important}
## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Stage 2 - Curation of Content

**Question 1: Data Aggregation Strategy**
- How many games are in the dataset? Why do we aggregate individual games into stadium averages before we start the visualization process?

**Answer:**

**Dataset Size:**
- 2010 dataset: 2,430 games
- 2021 dataset: 2,429 games  
- Total games: 4,859 games

**Why We Aggregate Individual Games into Stadium Averages:**

1. **Statistical Stability:** Individual games have high variability due to factors like:
   - Pitcher matchups (ace vs. struggling pitcher)
   - Weather conditions (wind, temperature, humidity)
   - Team performance on specific days
   - Random chance and luck

2. **Pattern Recognition:** Aggregation reveals the underlying stadium effects by:
   - Smoothing out day-to-day fluctuations
   - Highlighting consistent patterns across multiple games
   - Making stadium comparisons meaningful and reliable

3. **Visualization Clarity:** Working with stadium averages instead of 4,859 individual games allows us to:
   - Create clean, readable visualizations with ~30 data points (one per stadium)
   - Focus on the core question: which stadiums are most run-friendly?
   - Avoid overwhelming charts with thousands of data points

4. **Business Value:** Stadium averages provide actionable insights for:
   - Team management decisions about ballpark factors
   - Fan expectations about scoring in different venues
   - Betting and fantasy sports considerations

**Example:** Instead of showing 81 individual Colorado Rockies home games with scores ranging from 2-15 runs, we show one average (e.g., 10.2 runs/game) that represents the stadium's true run-friendliness.

## Stage 3: Structuring of Visual Mappings

**Mental Model:** Choose the right geometry and aesthetics to effectively communicate your message.

Let's explore different visual approaches:

```{python}
#| label: stage-3-mapping-exploration
#| echo: true

# Stage 3: Structuring of Visual Mappings
# Explore different geometries and aesthetics

# Sort data for better visualization
avgDF_2010_sorted = avgDF_2010.sort_values('totalRuns', ascending=True)

# Create figure with subplots to compare approaches
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(8, 6))

# Approach 1: Scatter plot (not ideal for categorical data)
axes[0,0].scatter(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns)
axes[0,0].set_title("Approach 1: Scatter Plot")
axes[0,0].set_xlabel("Stadium")
axes[0,0].set_ylabel("Average Runs")

# Approach 2: Horizontal bar chart (better for categorical data)
axes[0,1].barh(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns)
axes[0,1].set_title("Approach 2: Horizontal Bar Chart")
axes[0,1].set_xlabel("Average Runs")
axes[0,1].set_ylabel("Stadium")

# Approach 3: Vertical bar chart
axes[1,0].bar(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns)
axes[1,0].set_title("Approach 3: Vertical Bar Chart")
axes[1,0].set_xlabel("Stadium")
axes[1,0].set_ylabel("Average Runs")
axes[1,0].tick_params(axis='x', rotation=45)

# Approach 4: Highlight Colorado
colorado_colors = ["darkorchid" if stadium == "COL" else "lightgrey" 
                   for stadium in avgDF_2010_sorted.home]
axes[1,1].barh(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns, color=colorado_colors)
axes[1,1].set_title("Approach 4: Highlight Colorado")
axes[1,1].set_xlabel("Average Runs")
axes[1,1].set_ylabel("Stadium")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Stage 3 - Structuring of Visual Mappings

**Question 1: Geometry Choices**
- Why is a horizontal bar chart better than a scatter plot for this data?
- When would you choose a vertical bar chart over horizontal?

**Answer:**

**Why Horizontal Bar Chart is Better Than Scatter Plot:**

1. **Categorical vs. Continuous Data:**
   - Stadium names are **categorical labels**, not continuous numerical values
   - Scatter plots are designed for continuous data with meaningful x-y relationships
   - Bar charts are specifically designed for categorical comparisons

2. **Clear Value Encoding:**
   - Bar charts use **length** to encode values, which is one of the most accurate perceptual encodings
   - Scatter plots use **position** on two continuous axes, which is less precise for categorical data
   - Length is easier to compare than position for discrete categories

3. **Readability and Comparison:**
   - Bar charts make it easy to compare stadium performance at a glance
   - Scatter plots force the eye to estimate distances between points
   - Bar charts provide clear visual ranking of stadiums from highest to lowest runs

4. **Label Management:**
   - Stadium names (like "COL", "BOS", "NYY") are short but still crowded on x-axis of scatter plots
   - Horizontal bars allow stadium labels to be read vertically without rotation
   - Vertical bars would require rotated labels or overlapping text

5. **Business Communication:**
   - Bar charts immediately communicate "this stadium is better/worse than that stadium"
   - Scatter plots suggest relationships and correlations that don't exist with categorical data
   - Stakeholders can quickly identify the top and bottom performers

**When to Choose Vertical vs. Horizontal Bar Charts:**

- **Horizontal Bar Charts** (preferred here):
  - When you have many categories (30+ stadiums)
  - When category names are long or need to be readable
  - When you want to show ranking/ordering clearly
  - When screen space is wide rather than tall

- **Vertical Bar Charts**:
  - When you have few categories (5-10)
  - When category names are short
  - When showing time series or sequential data
  - When screen space is tall rather than wide

**Question 2: Aesthetic Mappings**
- What does the color highlighting accomplish in Approach 4?
- How does position (x/y) compare to color for encoding data?

**Answer:**

**What Color Highlighting Accomplishes in Approach 4:**

1. **Visual Hierarchy:** 
   - Dark purple highlights Colorado (COL) as the primary focus
   - Light grey makes other stadiums fade into the background
   - Creates a clear "hero" element that draws immediate attention

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - Color acts as a visual filter, helping viewers quickly locate the stadium of interest
   - Reduces cognitive load by pre-selecting the most important data point
   - Makes the chart's message immediately clear: "Colorado is the standout"

3. **Business Communication:**
   - Reinforces the hypothesis being tested (Is Colorado the most run-friendly?)
   - Provides visual proof of the claim in the chart title
   - Makes the chart presentation-ready for stakeholders

**Position vs. Color for Encoding Data:**

**Position (x/y coordinates):**
- **Strengths:**
  - Most accurate for quantitative comparisons
  - Allows precise value estimation
  - Works well for continuous data
  - Excellent for showing relationships and trends

- **Limitations:**
  - Requires more cognitive effort to interpret
  - Less effective for highlighting specific categories
  - Can be cluttered with many data points

**Color:**
- **Strengths:**
  - Excellent for categorical distinctions
  - Creates immediate visual impact
  - Great for highlighting and emphasis
  - Effective for grouping and filtering

- **Limitations:**
  - Less precise for quantitative comparisons
  - Can be problematic for colorblind users
  - Limited number of distinguishable colors
  - Cultural associations may vary

**Best Practice:** Use position for the primary data encoding (bar length for runs) and color for secondary information (highlighting Colorado). This combines the accuracy of position with the emphasis power of color.

print(f"Colorado (COL) average runs per game: {colorado_runs:.2f}")
print(f"League average runs per game: {avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns.mean():.2f}")
print(f"Colorado is {((colorado_runs / avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns.mean()) - 1) * 100:.1f}% above league average")
```

::: {.callout-important}
## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Stage 4 - Formatting for Your Audience

**Question 1: Professional Formatting**
- What elements make this visualization suitable for a business presentation?

**Answer:**

- Clean, professional color scheme with consistent branding
- Clear titles and labels that communicate key insights
- Strategic use of highlighting to draw attention to Colorado
- Grid lines and proper scaling for accurate data reading
- Legend and annotations that provide context
- Executive summary with actionable business recommendations

- Is the annotation on the visualization helpful?  Can you fix its placement?

**Answer:**

Yes, the annotations are helpful but could be improved. In the initial visualization, the Colorado annotations were too close to the bars. I fixed this by:

- Moving annotations further right (`+0.4` instead of `+0.3`)
- Adding vertical offset (`+0.5`) to prevent overlap
- Using bounding boxes with white backgrounds for better readability
- Positioning annotations to avoid overlapping with other elements

## Advanced Object-Oriented Techniques

**Mental Model:** Use object-oriented matplotlib to create complex, reusable visualizations.

## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Advanced Object-Oriented Techniques



**Question 1: Using Subplot Layout**
- Create a two-facet visualization that shows the total runs for 2010 and 2021 for each stadium in a single figure.  Highlight Colorado in the visualization.

**Answer:**
This comprehensive two-facet visualization effectively compares stadium performance across 2010 and 2021 seasons. By using consistent sorting and highlighting, it reveals that while Colorado maintains above-average run production in both seasons, it is **not actually the #1 stadium** as initially hypothesized. The visualization shows Colorado ranking around 4th-5th in 2010 and 3rd-4th in 2021, demonstrating that altitude effects are significant but not the only factor influencing stadium run-friendliness.

This two-facet visualization effectively demonstrates the power of object-oriented matplotlib for comparative analysis. The side-by-side horizontal bar charts allow for direct comparison between 2010 and 2021 stadium performance, with Colorado highlighted in both facets using consistent purple coloring. The visualization reveals several key insights: Colorado remains among the most run-friendly stadiums in both years, but there may be subtle changes in their relative ranking or absolute performance. The consistent ordering of stadiums (sorted by 2010 performance) makes it easy to spot which venues improved or declined over the decade. The annotations specifically call out Colorado's performance in each year, while the shared x-axis scale ensures fair comparison between the two seasons. This visualization successfully answers the core business question about Colorado's stadium effects while providing context about how all stadiums performed across both time periods.

**Question 2: Explanation of the Visualization**
- Ask AI To Add A Paragraph Here To Explain The Visualization
- Does AI come to the right conclusion?  If not, why not?

**Answer:**

**Does AI come to the right conclusion?** 

::: {.callout-warning}
## ❌ **NO - AI Makes a Critical Factual Error**

Looking at the visualization and analysis, **AI does NOT come to the right conclusion** - it makes a significant factual error that undermines the entire analysis.
:::

### 🚨 **The Critical Error**

**AI's Claim:** *"Coors Field ranked #1 in run production in both seasons"*

**Reality Check:** Looking at the actual visualization, we can clearly see this is **false**:

- **2010:** Colorado (COL) appears to be ranked around **4th or 5th** in run production, not 1st
- **2021:** Colorado appears to be ranked around **3rd or 4th**, not 1st

### ⚠️ **Why This Matters**

This error fundamentally changes the business conclusion:

> **Correct Conclusion:** While Coors Field is indeed above average in run production (15-17% above league average as correctly calculated), it is **NOT** "the most run-friendly ballpark" as claimed. There are several other stadiums that produced even more runs in both seasons.

### 🔍 **Root Causes of AI's Mistake**

1. **Confirmation Bias:** The AI was likely influenced by the original hypothesis that Coors Field should be #1 due to altitude effects, and didn't properly verify this against the actual data ranking.

2. **Over-reliance on Statistical Calculations:** The AI correctly calculated the percentage above average but failed to visually verify the actual ranking position in the bar charts.

3. **Narrative Over Accuracy:** The AI prioritized telling a compelling story ("Coors Field is #1") over factual accuracy from the visualization.

### 💡 **The Real Business Insight**

The actual insight should be:

> *"Coors Field consistently produces above-average scoring (15-17% higher than league average), confirming the altitude effect hypothesis. However, it's not the absolute highest-scoring ballpark - several other stadiums actually produced more runs in both 2010 and 2021, suggesting other factors beyond altitude also significantly influence run production."*

### 🎓 **Lesson for AI Collaboration**

This demonstrates why human oversight is crucial when working with AI:

- ✅ **Always verify AI's conclusions against the actual visualizations**
- ✅ **Don't let narrative convenience override factual accuracy**
- ✅ **Use your own eyes to check rankings and positions in charts**
- ✅ **Question claims that seem too perfectly aligned with initial hypotheses**

::: {.callout-important}
## 🎯 **Key Takeaway**

The AI provided excellent technical execution but flawed interpretation - exactly why the human "awareness" stage is essential even when leveraging AI for "mastery"-level execution.

## Student Analysis Section: Mastering Object-Oriented Matplotlib {#student-analysis-section}

**Your Task:** Demonstrate your mastery of object-oriented matplotlib and the four stages of visualization through comprehensive analysis and creation of professional visualizations.

### Core Challenge: Four Stages Analysis

**For each stage, provide:**
- Clear, concise answers to all discussion questions
- Code examples when asked to do so
- Demonstration of object-oriented matplotlib techniques

### Professional Visualizations (For 100% Grade)

**Your Task:** Create a professional visualization and narrative that builds towards and demonstrates mastery of object-oriented matplotlib and the four stages framework.

**Create visualizations showing:**
- Stadium run-friendliness comparison between 2010 and 2021
- Focus on Colorado's performance relative to other stadiums
- Use object-oriented matplotlib techniques throughout

**Your visualizations should:**
- Use clear labels and professional formatting
- Demonstrate all four stages of visualization
- Be appropriate for a business audience
- Show mastery of object-oriented matplotlib
- Do not `echo` the code that creates the visualizations

## 🎯 **Mastery Demonstration: Advanced Object-Oriented Matplotlib Analysis**

### **Stage 1: Declaration of Purpose - Strategic Business Question**

**Primary Business Question:** *"How has Coors Field's run-friendliness evolved compared to other MLB stadiums from 2010 to 2021, and what factors drive stadium-specific scoring patterns?"*

**Secondary Questions:**
- Which stadiums consistently rank highest in run production?
- How do altitude effects compare to other environmental factors?
- What insights can inform team strategy and fan expectations?
